## Installation Review

Setting up the plugin from the source code was a rather complex process. The documentation only provides a very superficial overview of the installation steps, which made it difficult to get everything running smoothly. A more detailed, step-by-step guide would be extremely helpful.

To improve the setup experience, the project should offer containerized deployment options (e.g., Docker images or docker-compose files). This would allow users to quickly spin up a working environment without having to manually configure all dependencies.
