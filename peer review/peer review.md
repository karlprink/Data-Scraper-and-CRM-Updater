## Code Review

This codebase presents a well-structured foundation, utilizing a consistent template across all components, which promotes readability and maintainability. Module names are logically chosen, and the code is well-commented, suggesting a strong adherence to clarity and quality standards.

The primary area for improvement is in the onboarding process: a clear, step-by-step guide on how to build and execute the code should be featured in the README to simplify the currently complex startup procedure.

## Installation Review

Setting up the plugin from the source code was a rather complex process. The documentation only provides a very superficial overview of the installation steps, which made it difficult to get everything running smoothly. A more detailed, step-by-step guide would be extremely helpful.

To improve the setup experience, the project should offer containerized deployment options (e.g., Docker images or docker-compose files). This would allow users to quickly spin up a working environment without having to manually configure all dependencies.
